Commented XML files from maps in the rotation. Files are split up into their individual modules and the module's function is described. Each section contains a link [<i class="fa fa-share"></i>](#) to the relevant module's page.

<div class="alert alert-warning"><strong>Note!</strong> The XML code examples may be outdated and use depreciated features.<br/> Always check the relevant modules page to make sure that the features or specifications you intend to use are still valid.</div>
