<p>After proto <code>1.3.3</code> and above, the order that you <a href="/modules/regions#applying">apply</a> filters to regions affects their behavior.
        Here's an example.</p>
<p>Let's start out with a basic filter that <strong>denies</strong> everything <strong>except</strong> TNT.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;filter name="only-tnt"&gt;
    &lt;block&gt;tnt&lt;/block&gt;
&lt;/filter&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Now let's apply this filter to <code>Region A</code>, and also apply a filter to <code>Region B</code> that denies all blocks.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;apply block="only-tnt" region="region-a"/&gt;

&lt;apply block="never" region="region-b"/&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>However, there is one slight complication. <code>Region B</code> is inside of <code>Region A</code>.
        So which filter will override the other? This is where the apply order comes in handy.</p>
<p><img alt="Apply Order .png" src="/img/apply_order.png"/></p>
<p>The order that you put the <code>&lt;apply&gt;</code>'s can change the outcome when something gets filtered.
        In the previous example, the <code>only-tnt</code> filter would always override the <code>never</code> filter since it is above it.
        The apply for <code>region B</code> won't get checked since it overlaps completely with <code>region A</code> and <code>region A</code> never returns abstain.</p>
<p>If we changed the order of the filters:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;apply block="never" region="region-b"/&gt;

&lt;apply block="only-tnt" region="region-a"/&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Now you cannot place blocks in <code>Region B</code>, but outside of it in <code>Region A</code> you can only place TNT blocks.</p>
<p>Although this may not be an issue for many maps such as a Blitz map or a TDM,
        this is a crucial concept for many DTC/DTM/CTW maps that use the <code>&lt;void/&gt;</code> filter.
        Usually it's best to have the <code>&lt;void/&gt;</code> filter at the lowest priority (at the bottom of the list).</p>
<p>A map developer will be able to help you through this process to ensure that your map's regions and filters are properly working.</p>
