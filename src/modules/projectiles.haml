                    Bows can be modified to shoot a different projectile at a custom speed. The PGM plugin will calculate the damage the projectile does using the same formula as minecraft does for arrows. This means that a flying fish with a velocity of 40 will almost certainly kill you. Projectiles can also have custom [potion effects](/modules/potions) which are applied to the target when it is hit.

                        <modifybowprojectile>
                            <projectile>EnderPearl</projectile>
                            <velocityMod>2.5</velocityMod>

                            <!-- Projectile potion effect -->
                            <potion duration="5" amplifier="1">poison</potion>
                        </modifybowprojectile>

                        <modifybowprojectile>
                            <potion duration="8" amplifier="1">wither</potion>
                        </modifybowprojectile>


                    `NOTE:` You can currently only modify all projectiles, this means no normal and custom bow at the same time.

                    All the following projectiles are guaranteed to work. See [mrapple/Bukkit Entity Spawning.md](https://gist.github.com/4617111) for a list of tested entities.
