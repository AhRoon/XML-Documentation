                    #### Changes in 1.4.0

                    * Filters, regions, and kits now use `id` instead of `name`. Keep in mind that IDs are all in the same namespace, so you can't use the same ID for two different types of thing.
                    * Teams are always referenced by ID everywhere in XML, never by name.
                    * The top-level tags `<filters>` and `<regions>` are now the same thing. You can define filters, regions, and `<apply>`s in either one (remember that regions are a type of filter, have been for a while now).
                    * Standalone filter definitions are no longer wrapped in a `<filter>` tag, they start with an actual filter, just like regions, e.g.

                        ```
                        <filters>
                            <team id="only-red">red-team</team>
                        </filters>
                        ```

                    * Any filter tag anywhere can have an `id` attribute.
                    * The `<apply>` tag accepts both references and inline definitions for its region, kit, and all of its filter properties, e.g. the two tags below are equivalent:

                        ```
                        <apply region="effect-pad" kit="effect-kit" filter="only-red" block="only-leaves" />

                        <apply>
                            <region>
                                <cuboid min="1,2,3" max="4,5,6"/> <!-- effect-pad -->
                            </region>
                            <kit>
                                <potion>...</potion> <!-- effect-kit -->
                            </kit>
                            <filter>
                                <team>red-team</team>
                            </filter>
                            <block>
                                <material>leaves</material>
                            </block>
                        </apply>
                        ```

                    * The region for an `<apply>` must be either a `region` attribute or a `<region>` sub-element. It cannot appear directly inside the `<apply>` tag.
                    * Inline filters must always be a single tag, multiple tags are not accepted anywhere. To combine multiple filters, always use a compound filter like `<all>` or `<any>`. This change is retroactive, and affects _all_ proto versions.
                    * There is no longer a filter type called `<block>`, use `<material>` instead. `<block>` is always interpreted as a region.
                    * The old built-in filters are gone, and there are only two new ones: `always` which is equivalent to `allow-all`, and `never` which is equivalent to `deny-all`. There are also two built-in regions called `everywhere` and `nowhere` that contain all points and no points, respectively. All four of the new built-ins have equivalent tags of the same name i.e. `<always/>`, `<never/>`, `<everywhere/>`, and `<nowhere/>`.
                    * Filters can no longer have parents.
                    * `<allow>` and `<deny>` can now be used anywhere a filter is expected, and actually function how they were supposed to i.e. they cause the filter to be ignored (skipped over) if it does not match.
                    * There is a new half-space region type that contains everything on one side of an arbitrary plane. The plane is defined by an origin point and a normal vector, and the region contains everything on the side of the plane that the normal is pointing towards. The example below defines a region with a diagonal boundary:

                        ```
                        <half origin="5,0,0" normal="1,1,0"/>
                        ```

                    * Two new region types `<above>` and `<below>` can be used to conveniently define axis-aligned half-spaces:

                        ```
                        <above y="50"/>    <!-- everything above Y=50 -->
                        <below x="0" z="0"/>    <!-- everything in the -X, -Z quadrant -->
                        ```

                    <br/>
                    #### Changes in 1.3.6

                    * Regions for cores, destroyables, wools, portals & score boxes must be defined in a `<region>` sub-element or referenced in a `region` attribute.

                        ```
                        <core>
                            <region>
                                <cuboid blah blah/>
                            </region>
                        </core>

                        <core region="my-region"/>
                        ```

                    * Similarly spawn regions must be defined in a `<regions>` sub-element or referenced in a `regions` attribute.

                        ```
                        <spawns>
                            <spawn team="red">
                                <regions yaw="90">
                                    <cuboid min="1,0,2" max="3,0,4"/>
                                    <cylinder base="7,8,9" radius="5" height="0"/>
                                </regions>
                            </spawn>
                        </spawns>
                        ```

                    * Everything scores 0 points by default, this means you have to explicitly define `<kills>` and `<deaths>` in the score module if you want players to get points for killing players.
