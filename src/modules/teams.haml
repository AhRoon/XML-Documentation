                    Setup the teams, their names and represented colors. See [bukkit colors](/reference/formatting) for valid team colors. The player limit for each team is defined inside of the `max=""` attribute. Teams can have a custom overhead color with the `overhead-color=""` attribute. Max overfill sets the hard limit for team sizes. If no max overfill is explicitly defined the default will be set to 25% over the maximum team size. Players will not be able to join teams once the max overfill team size is reached.

                    Teams are referenced in [regions](/modules/regions), [spawns](/modules/spawns) etc., by their name. The name matcher is case insensitive and fuzzy. For example, the teams below can be referenced with either `"Red Team" / "Blue Team"` or simply `"red" / "blue"`. When referencing teams care should be taken to make it obvious which team is being specified.

                    `NOTE:` It is common for maps to only have 2 teams, although more are possible. It usually just causes confusion. 

                        <teams>
                           <team color="dark red" max="50" max-overfill="70">Red Team</team>
                           <team color="blue" max="50" max-overfill="70">Blue Team</team>
                        </teams>

                    The total maximum number of players in the example given above is 100, however, the max overfill will allow up to 140 players. Servers currently have a player limit of 150, so 100 players in total would allow 50 observers, or 10 observers if teams are at max overfill.
